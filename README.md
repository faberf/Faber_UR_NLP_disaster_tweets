# Quick Start Developing

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Open in Dev Container**:

   - Launch Visual Studio Code: `code .`
   - Reopen the folder in a Dev Container when prompted, or click the **><** icon in the bottom-left corner and select **"Reopen in Container"**.

3. **Start Developing**:

   - Once the container is ready, your Conda environment `dev_env` with Python 3.11 will be activated automatically.
